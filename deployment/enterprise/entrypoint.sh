# Settings passed to gunicorn have the following order of precedence
# (tested using --workers):
#
# 1. Command-line (highest)
# 2. Environment variable
# 3. File referenced by --config (lowest)
#
# We store a base config in config.py and override things as needed
# using the environment variable GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS.

#  /bin/bash -c "gunicorn --config config.py application:application"
